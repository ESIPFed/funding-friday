Some potential indicators that will be explored are: walkability and public transit, local-businesses versus chains, and correlation exceptions... This project is highly exploratory, and the methods and relevant indicators will change and develop with the project.",

The project will develop a use case describing the existing issues related to stewardship of physical data and work on building connections between these diverse communities.",
